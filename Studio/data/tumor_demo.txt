The tumor_demo.zip an be copied into your PhysiCell /user_projects folder and unzipped there.
Then from the PhysiCell root directory, do:

make load PROJ=tumor_demo
make 

to create the "project" executable.

Then run the Studio:

python path-to-studio/bin/studio.py -e project   # uses the default config/PhysiCell_settings.xml

(but there is also a backup copy of the config file: tumor_demo.xml)
